# Intro to Ansible ELAG 2019 - Development Environment
A workshop by Chad Nelson / [bibliotechy](https://github.com/bibliotechy) / [@bibliotechy](https://twitter.com/bibliotechy)

## What you'll find here

This repository contains the basic configuration for a Vagrant machine that we will run while building an Ansible playbook together. 

### Other branches
Two other branches are also present, which contain endgoals for some of the work we will do together during the workshop. Feel free to peak at them if you are interested, but I will be expected you to work through the exercise I have put together, 

## What you need to get started

You will need a few things installed before you can get started. Follow the instructions for you OS.

* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#installation) - latest release is fine.
